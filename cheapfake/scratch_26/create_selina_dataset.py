MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I STAND BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING IN BAREFACED AWE OF THE MAJESTY OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.

WHAT A NIGHT.

YESTERDAY, ACROSS OUR GREAT LAND YOU WENT TO THE POLLS AND YOU VOTED. 
AND WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR MY OPPONENT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING YOUR PATRIORIC DUTY.

IN A DEMOCRACY SUCH AS OURS, IT FALLS TO THE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THEIR PRESIDENT, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU ATTEMPTED TO DO LAST NIGHT. 

NOW WHEN YOU VOTED, YOU HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT NO MATTER WHO WON, BY THIS MORNING THERE WOULD BE A CLEAR OUTCOME AND WE WOULD KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OR MY OPPONENT, FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

HOWEVER THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

AS IT TURNED OUT, THERE IS A VIRTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED TIE IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, A SOMEWHAT ARCANE INSTITUTION THAT MANY SCHOLARS BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO AWAY WITH.

I WISH TO SAY ON A PERSONAL NOTE, HOW HONOURED I AM THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS A TIE IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, I AM MOST PRIVILEGED TO HAVE WON THE POPULAR VOTE. 

I AM TRULY HUMBLED BY THIS UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT OF YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE MANY BOLD INITIATIVES WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN DURING MY BRIEF TIME IN OFFICE SO FAR. 
THANK YOU.

AND THOUGH THIS TIME MAY BE FRUSTRATING TO SOME, I WANT TO ASSURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD, AS WELL AS OUR ENEMIES, THAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS IN THEIR INFINITE WISDOM ANTICIPATED JUST SUCH AN EVENTUALITY AND HAVE PROVIDED A MECHANISM TO RESOLVE IT.

IT IS A FAIR AND JUDICIOUS METHOD TO DECIDE A MATTER THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.

IT IS NOT, HOWEVER, INSTANTANEOUS.
SO I MUST ASK FOR YOUR PATIENCE FOR THE TIME IT WILL TAKE FOR THE FOUNDERS BRILLIANT PLAN TO TAKE ITS COURSE.

SENATOR O'BRIEN AND I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT AND HE HAS PLEDGED HIS SUPPORT AND LOYALTY TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY AND TO THE PERSON WHO HOLDS IT.

AS SOMEONE WITH A LIFETIME OF PUBLIC SERVICE, BILL CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYONE HOW CRUCIAL IT IS THAT WE SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE AND UNITE BEHIND THE SITTING PRESIDENT AS THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, OUR COUNTRY IS NOT LEADERLESS.

I REMAIN AS YOUR PRESIDENT WITH MY HAND FIRMLY ON THE TILLER OF THE SHIP OF STATE.

YOUR GOVERNMENT IS STILL OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

SO REMEMBER NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTED FOR I AM YOUR PRESIDENT AND WITH GOD'S FRACE YOU AND I WILL NEVER STOP WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE A MORE PERFECT UNION. THANK YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
